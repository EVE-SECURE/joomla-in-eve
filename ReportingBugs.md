#What are Wiki and Issues for

# Wiki #

The wiki provides simple guides how to install or configure GUI. If some step is not explained properly, feel free to ask in comments for further explanation. I'll try to clear it up and update the wiki page.

**DON'T REPORT PROBLEMS IN WIKI**

# Issues #

Report only one bug per Issue. If you are experiencing multiple problems, create Issue for each one. Otherwise it's nightmare to keep track on problems that are fixed and that are not.

Specify, what version you are using. Both core component (com\_eve) and component you have problem with (com\_eve...)

Always include URL of page with problem
Administration example: `administrator/index.php?option=com_eve&view=characters`
Site with SEO enabled: `my-characters/c/123456789-Mychar.html` (menu link `index.php?option=com_eve&view=user`)

Try to explain what you see and what you want to see as closely as possible. "I don't see anything" is bad bug report, unless you are staring at blank page. Bonus points for pictures.

Turn on debug mode in `Administration -> Global Configuration -> System -> Debug System` Especially useful for MySQL errors or missing tables.
