#summary Setting up the IGB template
#labels Phase-Deploy,Deprecated

= Installation =

Go to _Extensions_ -> _Install/Uninstall_ and install package.


= Setting up =

*Don't use IGB template as default template*. Go to _Extensions_ -> _Plugin Manager_ -> _System - EVE_ and set _IGB Template_ to name of template you want to use in IGB.

= Overrides =

Standard Joomla! components and modules produce output that IGB isn't able to render. To remedy this issu you'll have to make a template override for almost any module/component you want to use. [http://docs.joomla.org/How_to_override_the_output_from_the_Joomla!_core Please see official Joomla! documentation on the issue]

*Deprecated soon. There will probably no IGB template for new moondoggie browser*
