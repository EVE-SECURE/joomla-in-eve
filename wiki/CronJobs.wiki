  * Download cron.zip

  * Set your crontab to execute `cron/index.php`


== Details ==

For some reason, Joomla! doesn't support scheduling tasks by any _normal_ way. So I had to add another entry point for Joomla!, similar to administration, installation or xmlrpc. So, what does it do:
  * Load Joomla! framework
  * Load `cron` plugins (`plugins/cron/*.php`)
  * Trigger `onCronTick` event
  * Let the plugins handle their job
