== Details ==

For some reason, Joomla! doesn't support scheduling tasks by any _normal_ way. So I had to add another entry point for Joomla!, similar to administration, installation or xmlrpc. So, what does it do:

  * Load `cron` plugins (`plugins/cron/*.php`)
  * Trigger `onCronTick` event
  * Let the plugins handle their job
